# sunrise_sunset

A project as part of May 2022, Elevate Challenge "Design a Clock".
An expansion on one of my Genuary 2022 submission, revisit the site at different times and the sun will be at different parts of the screen as it "rises" and as it 
sets". Twice a day, for one hour each, the sky explodes with yellow and oranges for the sunrise and sunset.
